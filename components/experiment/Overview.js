            <p>You will be asked to complete two tasks in this experiment.</p>
            <p>
                The first task is an assessment of working memory capacity. In
                this task, you will be asked to recall a series of number and
                colour pairs. Your performance will depend on the number of
                pairs you can accurately recall.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second task is a valuation game. In this task, you will be
                offered a price to enter into a gamble with uncertain payoffs.
                Your performance will depend on your ability to identify and
                accept cheap offers, and reject expensive offers.
            </p>
            <p>This experiment will take roughly one hour to complete.</p>
